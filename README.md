# UI/UX For Neurodivergent Users

## Purpose Statement

This repository aggregates a very modest collection of resources which have been written by credible sources and which were intended to foster discussions, and suggest best practices, for creating user experiences and user interfaces that cater to the needs of neurodiverse users. 

To respect the copyright of the authors, unmodified resources, in their originals, will not be included, but rather linked to in a single file: `resources.md`.
